# CI-CD-pipeline
Automating build, test, and deployment workflows using Docker and GitHub Actions for a modern CI/CD pipeline.

This repository demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline setup for a containerized application. It uses Docker for consistent packaging and GitHub Actions for automating the entire lifecycle:

🔁 Continuous Integration: Automated testing on every push

🚀 Continuous Deployment: Auto-deploy to staging/production environments

📦 Dockerized Builds: Reproducible environments using Docker and Docker Compose

🧪 Test Automation: Unit and integration tests in isolated containers

☁️ Container Registry: Push built images to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry

✅ Supports branching strategies, rollback workflows, and environment-specific configurations.
